Create a docker image that contains a simple session-based login (in either PHP or NodeJS) that queries a
database for two names:
- user: bobby, password: 1234
- user: sarah, password: 4567
these passwords should be hashed in the DB using a salted md5 algorithm.
You should be able to run the image using the command:
> docker run -p 80:80 --rm -d <your_image>
